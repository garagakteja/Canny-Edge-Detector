# Canny-Edge-Detector
Complete working implementation of  Canny's Edge Detector on 2D Images.(Sub-pixel level) 

This project can be further classfied into the below steps -

1. Gaussian Smoothing. (7*7 Gaussian Mask) 
2. Horizontal and Vertical Gradient Operation. (Prewitt's Operator) 
3. Magnitude and Gradient Angle. 
3. Non-Maxima Suppression. 
4. Thresholding (P-Tile Method at 10%, 30% and 50%)

Technologies/Language - Python : NumPy, OpenCV.
